    // [[noreturn]] (C++11)  tells the compiler that a function will not return

Helps catch logical errors in cases where ignoring a return value could result in bugs, e.g., ignoring error codes in functions.

When designing finite state machines or complex control structures with switch, this attribute ensures readability and prevents unintentional fallthrough.

The compiler can then make optimizations based on this assumption, but if the condition fails, the behavior is undefined. Use this attribute in highly performance-sensitive code where you want to help the compiler optimize based on known truths.
